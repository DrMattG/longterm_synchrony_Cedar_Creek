# longterm_synchrony_Cedar_Creek
Code for the paper "Short-term versus multi-decadal responses of community synchrony, stability, and biodiversity to multiple global change drivers"

Contains: 1. Raw community data (/data), 2. Cleaned data and subsetted dataframes (cleaning_CC.R and subsetting_CC.R), 3. Models and analyses (5_SEM_Figures_and_Effects.R), and 4. Supplemental analyses (S4_SEM_Figures_and_Effects_supp.R). See below for additional detail. Additionally contains functions for calculating the Evar metric and Box-Cox transformations (functions.R) and exported figure (/Figures) and table (/Tables) files.

1. (Kaitlyn, I thought it would be good organization to list brief summaries above, then use this numbered list if more detail is needed. Above was the same amount of detail I included in my modeling paper (aka not in depth), but as I didn't have raw data files to explain I wanted to leave an option to say more about those if needed.)
